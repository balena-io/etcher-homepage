# Homepage for Etcher

The HTML structure for the homepage is stored in `template.html`, and the text
for that page is in `data.json`. `index.html` is generated by `gulp` using these
two files. To contribute changes to this website, edit those two files and then
re-run `gulp` to update the rendered HTML.

#### Install deps
```
