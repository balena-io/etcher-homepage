There was a separate track for each Mac/Windows/Ubuntu and several manual and error prone steps along the way.",
        "To our surprise there was nothing out there that fitted our needs. So we built Etcher, a SD card burner app that is simple for end users, extensible for developers, and works on any platform. "
